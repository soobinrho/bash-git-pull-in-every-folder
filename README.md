# Overview

I use two laptops. I mostly write codes on my big laptop. This meant that whenever
I go back to my other laptop, there were many changes in my git repositories.
What I used to do before I wrote this script was to go into every git folder and 
then `git pull` every single time.

This script automates that so that one single command can do `git pull` in every git folder.

# Example

Suppose you have a folder at your home directory: ` ~/git` and you store all your
git repositories here:

    .
    ├── bash-git-pull-in-every-folder
    ├── bash-visualize-my-math-classes
    └── powershell-graphs-without-internet-access
